# Things to do

- Language server client (try some and find a good one)
    - probably vim-lsp, then waiting for nvim-lsp to be stable
- Wire everything together (completion, snippets, git) 
    - This is coming together at last

# Things to try

- omnibar : Denite is pretty complete, but heavy and sometimes buggy
    - should try fzf / crtlp again ? probably not
